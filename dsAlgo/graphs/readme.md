`🌳 Graphs Mastery Roadmap`

Here’s the step-by-step journey we’ll follow:

`🟢 Phase 1: Graph Fundamentals (Representation & Basics)`

Goal: Understand what graphs are, how to represent them, and basic terminology.

📚 Topics

What is a Graph?

Vertices (Nodes) & Edges

Directed vs Undirected

Weighted vs Unweighted

Cyclic vs Acyclic

Connected vs Disconnected

Graph Representations

Adjacency Matrix (2D array)

Adjacency List (Map / Object of arrays) ✅ (most common in coding interviews)

Graph Input/Output (How problems provide graphs)

🛠️ Tasks

Build an Adjacency List in JS (using {} instead of Map unless necessary 😉).

Convert between Adjacency Matrix ↔ List.

🎯 Practice

Represent a simple social network graph (e.g., friendships).

Convert a given matrix into an adjacency list.

`🟡 Phase 2: Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS)`

Goal: Learn how to explore all nodes in a graph.

📚 Topics

Depth First Search (DFS)

Recursive & Iterative (stack-based)

Breadth First Search (BFS)

Queue-based

Handling Disconnected Graphs

Detecting Cycles (basic)

🛠️ Tasks

Implement DFS & BFS on:

Undirected Graph (simple connections)

Directed Graph (one-way roads)

🎯 Practice Problems

Print all nodes of a graph using DFS/BFS.

Check if there is a path between two nodes.

Count the number of connected components.

`🟠 Phase 3: Graph Problems Using Traversals`

Goal: Apply BFS/DFS to solve real interview problems.

📚 Patterns & Problems

Detect a Cycle in:

Undirected Graph (using DFS)

Directed Graph (using DFS + recursion stack)

Find Number of Islands (LeetCode classic 🌴)

Clone a Graph (DFS + Hashing)

🛠️ Tasks

Implement Bipartite Check using BFS.

Solve Number of Provinces / Connected Components.

`🟠 Phase 4: Shortest Path Algorithms`

Goal: Find shortest paths in weighted/unweighted graphs.

📚 Topics

Unweighted Graphs → BFS for shortest path

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path)

Bellman-Ford (Handles negative weights)

Floyd-Warshall (All Pairs Shortest Path)

🛠️ Tasks

Shortest path in an unweighted graph (BFS).

Implement Dijkstra’s using a Priority Queue (Min Heap).

Practice negative weights with Bellman-Ford.

🎯 Practice

Shortest path in a maze/grid.

Network Delay Time (LeetCode).

`🟣 Phase 5: Advanced Graph Algorithms`

Goal: Master algorithms used in system design & competitive programming.

📚 Topics

Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm + DFS)

Union Find / Disjoint Set (DSU)

Path Compression

Union by Rank

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Kruskal’s Algorithm (Union Find)

Prim’s Algorithm

Kosaraju’s Algorithm (Strongly Connected Components)

🛠️ Tasks

Topological Sort with DFS & BFS.

Find MST using Kruskal’s & Prim’s.

Solve SCC problems with Kosaraju’s.

🎯 Practice

Course Schedule (LeetCode).

Minimum Cost to Connect All Points.

Critical Connections in a Network.

`🔵 Phase 6: Graph + Grids (2D problems)`

Goal: Use graph concepts on matrix/grid problems.

📚 Topics

Treating a matrix as a graph (4/8 directions).

BFS for Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix.

DFS for Max Area of Island.

Multi-source BFS (e.g., Rotten Oranges 🍊).

🎯 Practice

Walls and Gates

Rotting Oranges

Surrounded Regions

`🟢 Phase 7: Practice & Patterns`

Goal: Reinforce skills with interview problems.

🎯 Must-Solve Problems (LeetCode/Graph)

Number of Islands 🌴

Course Schedule (Topological Sort)

Clone Graph

Word Ladder

Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

Reconstruct Itinerary

`💡 Learning Style (Same as Linked List & Tree Plan)`

✅ Step 1: I’ll teach concept + brute force first, then optimize.
✅ Step 2: We’ll implement in JavaScript (plain objects for adjacency).
✅ Step 3: Each phase includes practice problems & edge cases.
✅ Step 4: I’ll give assignments after each milestone to reinforce.
