🛣️ Trie Roadmap
#`Stage 1 – Basics & Foundations`

✅ What is a Trie (prefix tree)

✅ How it stores words (shared prefixes)

✅ Hand-built examples (like we just did with "apple", "app", "ape", "bat", "ball")

🔜 Implement basic operations:

Insert(word)

Search(word)

StartsWith(prefix)

#`Stage 2 – Practical Applications`

Autocomplete system (given a prefix, return all words)

Word Dictionary with . as a wildcard (like regex a.d should match add)

Count prefix occurrences (how many words start with a prefix)

#`Stage 3 – Advanced Problems`

Longest word in dictionary (that can be built character by character from other words)

Replace words (prefix replacement problem from LeetCode)

Word Search II (finding words in a 2D board using a Trie)

Implementing a contact search system (like in a phonebook)

#`Stage 4 – Optimization & Variants`

Compressed Trie (radix tree / Patricia trie)

Suffix Trie (used for substring search problems)

Ternary Search Trie (memory-optimized)

#`Stage 5 – Real-World Connections`

Search engines (prefix queries)

Spell check & autocorrect

Predictive text (keyboard apps)

DNS lookup optimization
