##ðŸŒ³ Learning Path for Trees (our roadmap)

#Stage 1: Basics (Building Foundations)

TreeNode structure (âœ… you already know this)

Traversals (DFS): preorder, inorder, postorder (âœ… done)

Height / Depth of tree (âœ… done)

Count total nodes (âœ… done)

Sum of all nodes

Find maximum / minimum node

#Stage 2: Traversal Variants

Level Order Traversal (BFS with queue)

Count number of leaf nodes

Count number of full nodes (nodes with 2 children)

Count number of half nodes (nodes with 1 child)

#Stage 3: Problem Solving Patterns

Diameter of Binary Tree

Check if two trees are identical

Mirror of a tree

Check if tree is balanced

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

#Stage 4: Binary Search Tree (BST)

What is a BST (rules)

Search in BST

Insert in BST

Delete in BST

Check if tree is a BST

#Stage 5: Advanced Tree Problems

Path Sum problems (e.g., root-to-leaf sum = target)

Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree

Zigzag level order traversal

Boundary Traversal

Serialize & Deserialize a Binary Tree

#Stage 6: Special Trees

N-ary Trees basics

Trie (Prefix Tree) basics

Heap (Binary Heap) basics
